## Public data availability
Single-cell RNA-seq data generated for this study are publicly available via the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):

- GEO accession: GSE290679  
- Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE290679

Processed objects required to reproduce downstream analyses are available through the GEO record. Controlled-access raw sequencing data are available via dbGaP, as described in the manuscript.

## Repository structure
This repository is organized by figure and by preprocessing workflow.
